This repository houses a collection of files and resources utilized during the HackBio internship program, held from September to October 2024. The theme for this period was focused on Cancer, exploring various aspects and research areas related to oncology. The resources uploaded here include R scripts and the final reports of the various tasks that I was involved in, along with my team.
