**An outline of Breast Cancer Epidemiology**

**INTRODUCTION:**

Breast cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer among women, and now exceeds lung cancer as the primary cause of cancer. The disease's high occurrence rate, with over 2.3 million new diagnoses annually, remains a significant source of concern (Golestan et al. 2024). Metastasis refers to the spread of cancer to other organs within the body following cancer treatment/surgery. Approximately 5% of women experience breast cancer metastasis (Adnan et al. 2020). Recurrence occurs in approximately 30% of patients and metastatic recurrence accounts for 90% of cancer-related fatalities. Age, tumor size, stage, and lymph node involvement are all predictive markers of recurrence (Savva et al. 2024).

**SIGNIFICANCE OF BIOMARKER DISCOVERY:**

Despite advancements in screening and adjuvant therapy, 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of women with initial breast cancer still experiences recurrence of micro metastasis after 10 years. Developing a good biomarker for detecting breast cancer is thus crucial to understand the molecular mechanism of the disease (Safaei et al. 2013).

Mammography is the most effective technology for detecting breast cancer early on in women over the age of 50. Cancers less than 5 mm are frequently missed in imaging resolution. Furthermore, because thick breast tissue reduces mammographic sensitivity in young women, the usefulness of mammography has not been proven. High-grade cancers cannot be detected after 1-2 years of routine mammography imaging. New approaches are needed to enhance breast cancer diagnosis and increase patient survival rates (Safaei et al. 2013).

A biomarker is an objectively measurable chemical that identifies a patient's aberrant condition and tracks illness progression and/or therapeutic response. Biomarkers offer a dynamic approach to understanding cancer, with applications including epidemiology, clinical trials, screening, diagnosis, and prognosis (Safaei et al. 2013).

**APPLICATIONS OF BIOMARKER DISCOVERY:**

The introduction of biomarkers such as HER2, ER, and PR has transformed breast cancer diagnosis, allowing for exact classification of the disease into subtypes with distinct biological behaviours and therapeutic responses. HER2 amplification, for example, is not only a diagnostic marker but also a prognostic indicator, with HER2-positive tumours being associated with more aggressive illness and a higher response to HER2-targeted therapy (Waks & Winer, 2019).

**CONCLUSION:**

The discovery of novel biomarkers is a significant step in the early detection, diagnosis, and personalized treatment of breast cancer. Despite the limitations, such as the need for validation and the cancer heterogeneity, further research can lead to promising results. By combining developing technologies and biomarker discovery, we can move closer to more accurate, focused, and effective breast cancer management.
